%filterRegions  Filter BW image using auto-generated code from imageRegionAnalyzer app.
%  [BW_OUT,PROPERTIES] = filterRegions(BW_IN) filters binary image BW_IN
%  using auto-generated code from the imageRegionAnalyzer App. BW_OUT has
%  had all of the options and filtering selections that were specified in
